## Debugging?

What went wrong? Where? How to fix?

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Debugging Questions

* Can we reproduce the problem?
* What were the inputs to the model?
* Which exact model version was used?
* What data was the model trained with?
* What learning code (cleaning, feature extraction, ML algorithm) was the model trained with?
* Where does the data come from? How was it processed and extracted?
* Were other models involved? Which version? Based on which data?
* What parts of the input are responsible for the (wrong) answer? How can we fix the model?

# Data Provenance

Historical record of data and its origin
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Data Provenance

* Track origin of all data
    - Collected where?
    - Modified by whom, when, why?
    - Extracted from what other data or model or algorithm?
* ML models often based on data drived from many sources through many steps, including other models
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Tracking Data

* Document all data sources
* Model dependencies and flows
* Ideally model all data and processing code
* Avoid "visibility debt"
* 
* Advanced: Use infrastructure to automatically capture/infer dependencies and flows (e.g., [Goods](http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45390.pdf) paper)

## Partitioning Contexts

* Separate models for different subpopulations
* Potentially used to address fairness issues
* ML approaches typically partition internally already

## Overrides

* Hardcoded heuristics (usually created and maintained by humans) for special cases

* Guardrails
* Potential neverending attempt to fix special cases

<!-- smallish -->

* 62% of interviewees were not aware of curation algorithm
* Surprise and anger when learning about curation

> "Participants were most upset when close friends and
family were not shown in their feeds [...] participants often attributed missing stories to their friends’ decisions to exclude them rather than to Facebook News Feed algorithm."

* Learning about algorithm did not change satisfaction level
* More active engagement, more feeling of control

* Explain how the model made a decision
    - Rules, cutoffs, reasoning?
    - What are the relevant factors? 
    - Why those rules/cutoffs?
* Challenging in symbolic AI with complicated rules
* Challenging with ML because models too complex and based on data
    - Can we understand the rules?
    - Can we understand why these rules?

<!-- smallish -->

Hypotheses:
* It is a myth that there is necessarily a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability (when having meaningful features)
* Explainable ML methods provide explanations that are not faithful to what the original model computes
* Explanations often do not make sense, or do not provide enough detail to understand what the black box is doing
* Black box models are often not compatible with situations where information outside the database needs to be combined with a risk assessment
*  Black box models with explanations can lead to an overly complicated decision pathway that is ripe for human error
