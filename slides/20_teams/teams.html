    * Copilot: supports chief programmer in development tasks, represents team at meetings
    * Administrator: manages people, hardware and other resources
    * Editor: editing documentation 
    * Two secretaries: one each for the administrator and editor
    * Program clerk: keeps records of source code and documentation
    * Toolsmith: builds specialized programming tools
    * Tester: develops and runs tests
    * Language lawyer: expert in programming languages, provides advice on producing optimal code.

* "Synchronize and stabilize"
* For each milestone
    * 6-10 weeks feature development and continuous testing
frequent merges, daily builds

    * 2-5 weeks buffer

> As the functional departments grew, staffing the heavily matrixed projects became more and more of a nightmare. To address this, the company reorganized itself into “Studios”, each with dedicated resources for each of the major functional areas reporting up to a Studio manager. Given direct responsibility for performance and compensation, Studio managers could allocate resources freely.

> The Studios were able to exert more direct control on the projects and team members, but not without a cost. The major problem that emerged from Brøderbund’s Studio reorganization was that members of the various functional disciplines began to lose touch with their functional counterparts. Experience wasn’t shared as easily. Over time, duplicate effort began to appear.

* Centralized: development teams consult with a core group of  specialists when they need help
