</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Transcription services

* Take audio or video files and produce text.
    - Used by academics to analyze interview text
    - Podcast show notes
    - Subtitles for videos

* State of the art: Manual transcription, often mechanical turk (1.5 $/min)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The startup idea

PhD research on domain-specific speech recognition, that can detect technical jargon

DNN trained on public PBS interviews + transfer learning on smaller manually annotated domain-specific corpus

Research has shown amazing accuracy for talks in medicine, poverty and inequality research, and talks at Ruby programming conferences; published at top conferences

Idea: Let's commercialize the software and sell to academics and conference organizers

## Likely challenges?

<!-- discussion -->

<aside class="notes"><p>Ask students to write at least 3 challenges each, collect answers on board</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Data scientist

* Often fixed dataset for training and evaluation (e.g., PBS interviews)
* Focused on accuracy
* Prototyping, often Jupyter notebooks or similar 
* Expert in modeling techniques and feature engineering
* Model size, updateability, implementation stability typically does not matter

<!-- split -->

## Software engineer

* Builds a product
* Concerned about cost, performance, stability, release time
* Identify quality through customer satisfaction
* Must scale solution, handle large amounts of data
* Detect and handle mistakes, preferably automatically
* Maintain, evolve, and extend the product over long periods
* Consider requirements for security, safety, fairness

## Likely challenges?

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Qualities of Interest ("ilities")

* Quality is about more than the absence of defects
* Quality in use (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, freedom of risk, ...)
* Product quality (functional correctness and completeness, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, dependability, scalability, security, maintainability, portability, ...)
* Process quality (manageability, evolvability, predictability, ...)
* 
* "Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives." (many attributions)

## Garvin’s eight categories of product quality

* Performance
* Features
* Reliability
* Conformance
* Durability
* Serviceability
* Aesthetics
* Perceived Quality

## Relevant Qualities for Transcription Service?

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Examples for discussion

* What does correctness or accuracy really mean? What accuracy do customers care about?
* How can we see how well we are doing in practice? How much feedback are customers going to give us before they leave?
* Can we estimate how good our transcriptions are?
* How to present results to the customers (including confidence)?
* When customers complain about poor transcriptions, how to prioritize and what to do?
* 
* What are unacceptable mistakes and how can they be avoided?
* How quickly do we detect problems?
* How quickly can we fix mistakes? How?
* Will transcribing the same audio twice produce the same result? Does it matter?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Examples for discussion 2
 
* With more customers, transcriptions are taking longer and longer -- what can we do?
* Transcriptions sometimes crash. What to do?
* How do we achieve high availability?
* How can we see that everything is going fine and page somebody if it is not?
* Tensorflow update; does our infrastructure still work?
* Once somewhat successful, how to handle large amounts of data per day?
* Buy more machines or move to the cloud?
*
* Models are continuously improved. When to deploy? Can we roll back?
* Can we offer live transcription as an app? As a web service?
* Can we get better the longer a person talks? Should we then go back and reanalyze the beginning? Will this benefit the next upload as well?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Examples for discussion 3

* How many domains can be supported? Do we have the server capacity?
* How specific should domains be? Medical vs "International Conference on Allergy & Immunology"?
* How to make it easy to support new domains?
* 
* Can we handle accents? 
* Better recognition of male than female speakers?
* 
* Can and should we learn from customer data? 
* What could be possible privacy problems and how can we avoid them?
* Do we need to worry about security? Where?

## Benefits of Specifications

* Exact specification of what should be implemented
* Accurate blame assignments and identification of buggy behavior
* Useful for test generation and as test oracle

## Specifications in Machine Learning?

```java
/**

## Specifications in Machine Learning?

* Usually clear specifications do not exist
* Can define correctness for some data, but not general rules. Sometimes can only determine correctness after the fact.
* Learning for tasks for which we cannot write specifications
    - Too complex
    - Rules unknown
* AI will learn rules/specifications, but are those the right ones?
* 
* Often *goals* used instead --> maximize a specific objective

<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


(Daniel Miessler, CC SA 2.0)

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Deductive Reasoning

* Combining logical statements following agreed upon rules to form new statements
* Proving theorems from axioms
* From general to the particular
* *mathy reasoning, eg. proof that π is irrational*
* 
* Formal methods, classic rule-based AI systems, expert systems

<!-- split -->

## Inductive Reasoning

* Constructing axioms from observations
* Strong evidence suggests a rule
* From particular to the general
* *sciency reasoning, eg. finding laws of nature*
* 
* Most modern machine learning systems, statistical learning

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Shift in Design Thinking

From deductive reasoning to inductive reasoning

From clear specifications to goals

From guarantees to best effort

**What does this mean for software engineering? For correctness of AI-enabled systems? For testing?**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A Touch of Realism

While it is possible to formally specify programs and prove them correct, this is rarely ever done.

In practice, specifications are often textual, local, weak, vague, or ambiguous, if they exist at all. Some informal requirements and some tests might be the only specifications available.

Software engineers have long development methods to deal with uncertainty, missing specifications, and unreliable components.

**AI may raise the stakes, but the problem and solutions are not new.**

## The Notebook

> Jupyter Notebooks are a gift from God to those who work with data. They allow us to do quick experiments with Julia, Python, R, and more -- [John Paul Ada](https://towardsdatascience.com/no-hassle-machine-learning-experiments-with-azure-notebooks-e1a22e8782c3)

<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>Discuss benefits and drawbacks of Jupyter style notebooks</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Notebooks

* Allow quick and easy exploration and experimentation
* Literate programming intermixing text, code, and results
* Small code snippets, heavy use of libraries
* 
* Proof of concept on snapshot data only
* Poor abstraction and testing practices
* Low automation, often not scalable
* Difficult transition in production</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## AI and Technical Debt 

* AI can seem like an easy addition, but it may cause long-term costs
* Needs to be maintained, evolved, and debugged
* Goals may change, environment may change, some changes are subtle
* 
* Example problems
    - Systems and models are tangled and changing one has cascading effects on the other
    - Untested, brittle infrastructure; manual deployment
    - Unstable data dependencies, replication crisis 
    - Data drift and feedback loops
    - Magic constants and dead experimental code paths
