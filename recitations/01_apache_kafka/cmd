## Running SSH Tunnel to the course Kafka server

$ ssh -L 9092:localhost:9092 tunnel@128.2.204.215 -NTf

# Note: The tunnel process goes to the background after entering password, useful if you don't want to waste a terminal session.
# Skip the '-f' option if you don't care about this.
#
# To kill the tunnel, send a SIGKILL to the tunnel process:

# To find tunnel PID
$ ps -eaf | grep ssh 

# Send a SIGKILL to process with pid 10455
$ kill -9 10455

###

## Using Kafkacat
# Once a tunnel is up and running, you can connect to Kafka and play around with it

# Test connectivity to Kafka broker
$ kafkacat -b localhost -L

# Consume events from topic
$ kafkacat -b localhost -t <topic_name>

# Consume all events in topic
$ kafkacat -b localhost -t <topic_name> -o beginning
