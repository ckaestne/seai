# Typically, the easiest way to learn a command line tool, is to find a cheat sheet. Sometimes, the official documentation can be a little hard to begin with.
# For Docker, I find the official documentation to be really good. But there are a lot of cheat sheets that you can explore too.

# Note: All commands need to have root access. The 'sudo' before every command is omitted.
# Also, these are some of the bare minimum options that I find are good to specify. These are in no way exhaustive.


# List Images in Container Registry
$ docker ls

# Check for running containers
$ docker ps

# Building an Image (Note that -t can be specified multiple times to have different tags)
# Also, tagging the image with 'latest' to indicate the most up to date image is one of the best practices.

$ docker build -t <image_name:tag1> -t <image_name:tag2> -t <image_name:latest> <Path to Dockerfile>

$ docker build -t kartikri/demo-flask-server:1.0.0 -t kartikri/demo-flask-server:latest .


# Running a container
$ docker container run --name <name_of_container> -d -p <host_port:container_port> <image_name:tag>

$ docker container run --name demo-flask-server -d -p 7875:8082 kartikri/demo-flask-server:latest

# --name - Name to be given to the container after it spawns
# -d - Detached mode, container runs as a background process
# -p - port mapping (in our example, the traffic at port 7875 of VM will be forwarded to port 8082 of container)

# Tailing logs
$ docker logs demo-flask-server -f
