# Individual Assignment 1: Adversarial Advertisement Case Study

(17-445/645 Software Engineering for AI-Enabled Systems)

## Overview

Building a system with an AI component requires more than building and tuning a model. Understanding challenges in a specific project may help deriving insights for other projects. In this assignment, you will analyze the report for a project at Google to identify software engineering concerns in building a system.

Learning goals:
* Understand the scope of software engineering challenges when building an AI-enabled system
* Identify technical and nontechnical challenges
* Identify and describe measures for project success

## Tasks and Questions

Read the paper below and if necessary familiarize yourself with terminology and additional context, using other web and research publications on the topic as needed.

> Sculley, D., Matthew Eric Otey, Michael Pohl, Bridget Spitznagel, John Hainsworth, and Yunkai Zhou. [Detecting Adversarial Advertisements in the Wild](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub37195.pdf). In Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge dDiscovery and Data Mining, pp. 274-282. ACM, 2011.

Answer the questions below (<1 page per question). Wherever reasonable, provide evidence, for example by referring to specific parts of the source material. Your answers may contain opinions and speculations, but make sure that they are clearly recognizable as such and clearly separate opinions/speculations from facts. 

Concise and precise answers with a clear argument and structure are preferred over long, meandering collections of sentences.

Questions:

1. **Question 1:** What makes the problem of detecting adversarial advertisement hard? For example, why is a machine learning approach suiteable, rather than having a few specific hard-coded rules; can the problem be specified well?

2. **Question 2:** What qualities were important to the team in building the system? Identify relevant qualities and give a brief description of how the team could check whether those qualities are sufficiently achieved (e.g., with specific measures).

3. **Question 3:** What are engineering challenges that emerged during the project and how were those addressed? Separate data analytics concerns (in building an initial model) from engineering concerns (that are important for building and running a production system) and identify at least three engineering challenges for which the team had to make decisions. Justify why these were important challenges, what potential options the team had to address them, and summarize how the team actually addressed them.

4. **Question 4:** What lessons can be learned for future software projects of similar scale or importance? Identify and briefly describe at least two lessons that are worth sharing with other teams building AI-enabled systems, especially teams that are new to using AI techniques.

Submit your answers as a single PDF document to Canvas by __. Make sure your document is clearly structured, such that it is recognizable which answer belongs to which question.
