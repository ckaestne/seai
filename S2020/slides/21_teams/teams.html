* Social media company of about 1400 employees in the US, 300 developers and data scientists
* Use sentiment analysis on video data (and transcripts) to detect depression
* Planned interventions through recommending different content and showing ads for getting support, design for small group features
* Collaboration with mental health professionals and ML researches at top university

* Often fixed dataset for training and evaluation (e.g., PBS interviews)
* Focused on accuracy
* Prototyping, often Jupyter notebooks or similar 
* Expert in modeling techniques and feature engineering
* Model size, updateability, implementation stability typically does not matter

<!-- split -->

## Software engineer

* Builds a product
* Concerned about cost, performance, stability, release time
* Identify quality through customer satisfaction
* Must scale solution, handle large amounts of data
* Detect and handle mistakes, preferably automatically
* Maintain, evolve, and extend the product over long periods
* Consider requirements for security, safety, fairness

* "Synchronize and stabilize"
* For each milestone
    * 6-10 weeks feature development and continuous testing

    * 2-5 weeks buffer

<!-- smallish -->

> As the functional departments grew, staffing the heavily matrixed projects became more and more of a nightmare. To address this, the company reorganized itself into “Studios”, each with dedicated resources for each of the major functional areas reporting up to a Studio manager. Given direct responsibility for performance and compensation, Studio managers could allocate resources freely.

> The Studios were able to exert more direct control on the projects and team members, but not without a cost. The major problem that emerged from Brøderbund’s Studio reorganization was that members of the various functional disciplines began to lose touch with their functional counterparts. Experience wasn’t shared as easily. Over time, duplicate effort began to appear.

* Centralized: development teams consult with a core group of  specialists when they need help

* Strong Hybrid: centralized group of specialists and most teams also hire specialists
