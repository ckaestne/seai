# Case Study: The Transcription Service Startup
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
![competitor](transcription.png)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Transcription services

* Take audio or video files and produce text.
    - Used by academics to analyze interview text
    - Podcast show notes
    - Subtitles for videos

* State of the art: Manual transcription, often mechanical turk (1.5 $/min)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The startup idea

PhD research on domain-specific speech recognition, that can detect technical jargon

DNN trained on public PBS interviews + transfer learning on smaller manually annotated domain-specific corpus

Research has shown amazing accuracy for talks in medicine, poverty and inequality research, and talks at Ruby programming conferences; published at top conferences

Idea: Let's commercialize the software and sell to academics and conference organizers

* Model size, updateability, implementation stability typically does not matter

<!-- split -->

## Software engineer

* Builds a product
* Concerned about cost, performance, stability, release time
* Identify quality through customer satisfaction
* Must scale solution, handle large amounts of data
* Detect and handle mistakes, preferably automatically
* Maintain, evolve, and extend the product over long periods
* Consider requirements for security, safety, fairness

## Qualities of Interest ("ilities")

* Quality is about more than the absence of defects
* Quality in use (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, freedom of risk, ...)
* Product quality (functional correctness and completeness, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, dependability, scalability, security, maintainability, portability, ...)
* Process quality (manageability, evolvability, predictability, ...)
* 
* "Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives." (many attributions)

## Relevant Qualities for Transcription Service?

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Examples for discussion

* What does correctness or accuracy really mean? What accuracy do customers care about?
* How can we see how well we are doing in practice? How much feedback are customers going to give us before they leave?
* Can we estimate how good our transcriptions are? How are we doing for different customers or different topics?
* How to present results to the customers (including confidence)?
* When customers complain about poor transcriptions, how to prioritize and what to do?
* 
* What are unacceptable mistakes and how can they be avoided? Is there a safety risk?
* Can we cope with an influx of customers?
* Will transcribing the same audio twice produce the same result? Does it matter? 
* How can we debug and fix problems? How quickly?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Examples for discussion 2

* With more customers, transcriptions are taking longer and longer -- what can we do?
* Transcriptions sometimes crash. What to do?
* How do we achieve high availability?
* How can we see that everything is going fine and page somebody if it is not?
* We improve our entity detection model but somehow system behavior degrades... Why?
* Tensorflow update; does our infrastructure still work?
* Once somewhat successful, how to handle large amounts of data per day?
* Buy more machines or move to the cloud?
*
* Models are continuously improved. When to deploy? Can we roll back?
* Can we offer live transcription as an app? As a web service?
* Can we get better the longer a person talks? Should we then go back and reanalyze the beginning? Will this benefit the next upload as well?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Examples for discussion 3

* How many domains can be supported? Do we have the server capacity?
* How specific should domains be? Medical vs "International Conference on Allergy & Immunology"?
* How to make it easy to support new domains?
* 
* Can we handle accents? 
* Better recognition of male than female speakers?
* 
* Can and should we learn from customer data? 
* How can we debug problems on audio files we are not allowed to see?
* Any chance we might private leak customer data? 
* Can competitors or bad actors attack our system?

## Aside: AI vs ML

* Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term covering symbolic AI (problem solving, reasoning) as well as machine learning (statistical learning from data)
* This course focuses mostly on *statistical machine learning* and supervised learning (extrapolating from data, inductive reasoning)
* We will cover *symbolic AI* (expert systems, probabilistic reasoning, ...) selectively, often for contrast

## Specifications in Machine Learning?

* Usually clear specifications do not exist -- we use machine learning exactly because we do not know the specifications
* Can define correctness for some data, but not general rules; sometimes can only determine correctness after the fact
* Learning for tasks for which we cannot write specifications
    - Too complex
    - Rules unknown
* AI will learn rules/specifications, often not in a human-readable form, but are those the right ones?
* 
* Often *goals* used instead --> maximize a specific objective

[![](inductive.png)](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-difference-between-deductive-and-inductive-reasoning/)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


(Daniel Miessler, CC SA 2.0)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Deductive Reasoning

* Combining logical statements following agreed upon rules to form new statements
* Proving theorems from axioms
* From general to the particular
* *mathy reasoning, eg. proof that Ï€ is irrational*
* 
* Formal methods, classic rule-based AI systems, expert systems

<!-- split -->

## Inductive Reasoning

* Constructing axioms from observations
* Strong evidence suggests a rule
* From particular to the general
* *sciency reasoning, eg. finding laws of nature*
* 
* Most modern machine learning systems, statistical learning
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Resulting Shift in Design Thinking?

From deductive reasoning to inductive reasoning...

From clear specifications to goals...

From guarantees to best effort...

**What does this mean for software engineering?**

**For decomposing software systems?** 

**For correctness of AI-enabled systems?** 

**For safety?**

**For design, implementation, testing, deployment, operations?**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A Touch of Realism

While it is possible to formally specify programs and prove them correct, this is rarely ever done.

In practice, specifications are often textual, local, weak, vague, or ambiguous, if they exist at all. Some informal requirements and some tests might be the only specifications available.

Software engineers have long development methods to deal with uncertainty, missing specifications, and unreliable components.

**AI may raise the stakes, but the problem and solutions are not entirely new.**
