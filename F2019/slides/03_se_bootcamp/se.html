# Process
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Innovative vs Routine Projects

* Most software projects are innovative
    - Google, Amazon, Ebay, Netflix
    - Vehicles and robotics
    - Language processing, Graphics, AI
* Routine (now, not 20 years ago)
    - E-commerce websites?
    - Product recommendation? Voice recognition?
    - Routine gets automated -> innovation cycle
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A Simple Process

1. Discuss the software that needs to be written
2. Write some code
3. Test the code to identify the defects
4. Debug to find causes of defects
5. Fix the defects
6. If not done, return to step 1

## Example of Process Problems?

<!-- discussion -->

<aside class="notes"><p>Collect examples of what could go wrong:</p>
<p>Change Control: Mid-project informal agreement to changes suggested by customer or manager. Project scope expands 25-50%
Quality Assurance: Late detection of requirements and design issues. Test-debug-reimplement cycle limits development of new features. Release with known defects.
Defect Tracking: Bug reports collected informally, forgotten
System Integration: Integration of independently developed components at the very end of the project. Interfaces out of sync.
Source Code Control: Accidentally overwritten changes, lost work.
Scheduling: When project is behind, developers are asked weekly for new estimates.</p>

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Builds

* All but the smallest projects have a nontrivial build process 
* You want to capture and automate the knowledge of how to build your system, ideally in a single command 
* Build scripts are code (executable specifications) that need to be managed just like other pieces of code 
* Use a build tool to script building, packaging, testing, and deploying your system 
    * Most IDEs have an integrated build system 
+ Makes sure the application builds also on other machines
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Quality Assurance

* Dynamic techniques (executing the code, select inputs)
    - Testing 
    - Dynamic analysis/instrumentation
* Static techniques (not executing the code, all executions)
    - Code review/inspection
    - Static analysis, data-flow analysis
    - Formal verification
* Process quality
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Test automation

@Test
public void testSanityTest(){
    //setup
    Graph g1 = new AdjacencyListGraph(10);

    Vertex s2 = new Vertex("B");
    //check expected behavior
    assertEquals(true, g1.addVertex(s1));
    assertEquals(true, g1.addVertex(s2));

## Documentation and Naming

* Great code should not need documentation
    - Use self-documenting method and variable names
    - Named constants rather than magic numbers
* Documentation can still make it better though
*
* Document rationale, rather than repeating code
* API documentation at interfaces (contracts, information hiding) 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Defect Tracking

* Issues: Bug, feature request, query
* Basis for measurement (when, where, who, difficulty, ...)
* Facilitates communication 
    * questions back to reporter
    * ensures reports are not forgotten
* Accountability

<aside class="notes"><p>Although dated, the key idea is still essential -- think and plan before implementing. Not all requirements and design can be made upfront, but planning is usually helpful.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Requirements

> Requirements say what the system will do (and not how it will do it).

-

> The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build. 
> No other part of the conceptual work is as difficult as establishing the detailed technical requirements ... 
> No other part of the work so cripples the resulting system if done wrong. 
> No other part is as difficult to rectify later.     — Fred Brooks
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Functional Req.

* What the machine should do 
    - Input 
    - Output
    - Interface
    - Response to events 
* Criteria 
    - Completeness: All requirements are documented 
    - Consistency: No conflicts between requirements 
    - Precision: No ambiguity in requirements 

<!-- split -->

## Quality Requirements

* Specify the quality with which functionality is delivered
    - Performance, security, safety, maintainability, ...
* Can be more critical than functional requirements
    - Can work around missing functionality
    - Low-quality system may be unusable 
* Guide tradeoff decisions between conflicting requirements
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Qualities of Interest

* Quality in use (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, freedom of risk, ...)
* Product quality (functional correctness and completeness, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, dependability, scalability, security, maintainability, portability, ...)
* Process quality (manageability, evolvability, predictability, ...)

## Measurement 

> Measurement is the empirical, objective assignment of numbers, according to a rule derived from a model or theory, to attributes of objects or events with the intent of describing them. –- Craner, Bond, “[Software Engineering Metrics: What Do They Measure and How Do We Know?](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.2542)”  

-

> A quantitatively expressed reduction of uncertainty based on one or more observations. – Hubbard, “[How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business](https://www.howtomeasureanything.com/)”
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Everything is measureable

* If X is something we care about, then X, by definition, must be detectable. 
    * How could we care about things like “quality,” “risk,” “security,” or “public image” if these things were totally undetectable, directly or indirectly? 
    * If we have reason to care about some unknown quantity, it is because we think it corresponds to desirable or undesirable results in some way. 
* If X is detectable, then it must be detectable in some amount. 
    * If you can observe a thing at all, you can observe more of it or less of it 
* If we can observe it in some amount, then it must be measurable.

## Goal-Question-Metric Approach

Example:

* Goal: Analyze the unit test process to understand the impact of adding additional tests to project Alpha from the viewpoint of the project manager 
* Q1: What is current test time
    - Num. test run per week
    - Time per passing test
* Q2: How effective are we at finding defects
    - Time per passing test
    - Num. of tests that find defect
    - Defects found in unit testing

## Architecture and Design



Planning and making tradeoff decisions among alternative designs:
* Real-world constraints: budget, time, customer requirements
* Not all goals and qualities achievable -- prioritize and compromise
* Make tradeoff decisions among competing designs, e.g.,
    - scalable vs. accurate
    - provably correct vs. quickly delivered
    - first to market vs. fully featured
* Analysis and modeling before committing to an implementation

## Planning

> Planning is everything, the plan is nothing. 
> -- Dwight Eisenhower

* Effort estimation is difficult, requires practice and calibration
* "I’m 90% done" -- progress estimates are unreliable
   * use milestones with objective deliverables
* Replan, when changes occur
    - delays, changed requirements, technical problems, ...
    - request more time/money, reassign work, renegotiate requirements, ...

* Software seems changeable ("soft")
* Developers prone to changes and "extra features"
* Customers often do not understand what is easy to change and what is hard

* Requirements -> Delays -> Surprise!
