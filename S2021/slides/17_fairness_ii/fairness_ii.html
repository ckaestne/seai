*Recidivism scenario: Should a defendant be detained?*

* Anti-classification: Race and gender should not be considered for the decision at all
* Independence: Detention rates should be equal across gender and race groups
* Separation: Among defendants who would not have gone on to commit a
violent crime if released, detention rates are equal across gender and race groups

* COMPAS system, developed by Northpointe
	* Used by judges in sentencing decisions
	* In deployment throughout numerous states (PA, FL, NY, WI, CA, etc.,)

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Which fairness definition?

![](compas-metrics.png)

* ProPublica investigation: COMPAS violates separation w/ FPR & FNR
* Northpointe response: COMPAS is fair because it has similar FDRs
  across both races
  * FDR = FP / (FP + TP) = 1 - Precision
  * FPR = FP / (FP + TN)
* __Q. So is COMPAS both fair & unfair at the same time? Which definition
  is the "right" one?__

![](fairness-accuracy.jpeg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* Easy to pick some definition & claim that the model is fair
  * But is the __overall system__ actually fair?
* In general, impossible to satisfy multiple fairness definitions at
once
	* Also consider trade-offs against accuracy & other system goals
* Fairness is a __context-dependent__ notion!
	* Select the criteria that minimize harm for the given context
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Requirements & Fairness

![](machine-world.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* Fairness is a __context-dependent__ notion
* __Again, think about requirements!__
  * Who are the stakeholders of the system?
	* Which of these groups could be harmed?
  * What potential harms can be caused by biased decisions?
	* e.g., unfair punishments, denial to resources
  * Are there any legal constraints or policy goals?
	* e.g., 80% rule, affirmative actions 
  * How are these decisions related to the ML model? Errors?
	* e.g., false positives, false negatives
  * Which fairness metric minimizes the harm?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Practitioner Challenges

* Fairness is a system-level property
  - consider goals, user interaction design, data collection, monitoring, model interaction (properties of a single model may not matter much)
* Fairness-aware data collection, fairness testing for training data
* Identifying blind spots
  - Proactive vs reactive
  - Team bias and (domain-specific) checklists
* Fairness auditing processes and tools
* Diagnosis and debugging (outlier or systemic problem? causes?)
* Guiding interventions (adjust goals? more data? side effects? chasing mistakes? redesign?)
* Assessing human bias of humans in the loop

* Address under- & over-representation issues
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Ensure sufficient amount of data for all groups to avoid being
	treated as "outliers" by ML
	* Also avoid over-representation of certain groups (e.g.,
     remove historical data)

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Long-term Impact of ML

![](ml-cycle.png)

* ML systems make multiple decisions over time, influence the
behaviors of populations in the real world
* But most models are built & optimized assuming that the world is
static!
* Difficult to estimate the impact of ML over time
  * Need to reason about the system dynamics (world vs machine)
  * e.g., what's the effect of a loan lending policy on a population?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Long-term Impact & Fairness

![](fairness-longterm.png)
* Deploying an ML model with a fairness criterion does NOT guarantee
  improvement in equality over time
* Even if a model appears to promote fairness in
short term, it may result harm over a long-term period

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Monitoring & Auditing

* Continuously monitor for:
  - Match between training data, test data, and instances that you encounter in deployment
  - Fairness metrics: Is the system yielding fair results over time?
  - Population shifts: May suggest needs to adjust fairness metric/thresholds
  - User reports & complaints: Log and audit system decisions
    perceived to be unfair by users
* Deploy escalation plans: How do you respond when harm occurs due to
system?
	* Shutdown system? Temporary replacement?
	* Maintain communication lines to stakeholders
* Invite diverse stakeholders to audit system for biases
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Monitoring & Auditing

![](model_drift.jpg)

* Continously monitor the fairness metric (e.g., error rates for
  different groups)
