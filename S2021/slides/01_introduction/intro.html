Expect:
* Internet and bandwidth issues
* Timezone issues
* Distractions -- parents, siblings, pets
* Feeling isolated, feeling overwhelmed
* Many additional sources of stress
* Hard time dealing with -gestures widely- *everything*...

*Talk to us about accommodations of any kind*


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Simulating in-class experience

> Discussions and interactions are important. We'll have regular in-class discussions and exercises

* Use chat, "raise hand" feature, or just speak
* If possible, keep camera on, muted by default
* Set preferred name in Zoom
* If possible, attend lecture and recitation live (recordings and early-morning office hours as backup)
* 
* Suggestion: Have chat and participant list open, maybe separate window for gallery view for faces, second monitor highly recommended
* **Contact us for accommodations!**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Personal Connection

> This is hard. We know.

* Talk inside and outside of class
* We are here always 10 min before class and stay after class if you have questions, want to chat
* We encourage collaboration in all assignments, even "individual" assignments and reading quizzes
* We encourage social activities in teams

# Case Study: The Transcription Service Startup
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
![competitor](transcription.png)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Transcription services

* Take audio or video files and produce text.
    - Used by academics to analyze interview text
    - Podcast show notes
    - Subtitles for videos

* State of the art: Manual transcription, often mechanical turk (1.5 $/min)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The startup idea

PhD research on domain-specific speech recognition, that can detect technical jargon

DNN trained on public PBS interviews + transfer learning on smaller manually annotated domain-specific corpus

Research has shown amazing accuracy for talks in medicine, poverty and inequality research, and talks at Ruby programming conferences; published at top conferences

Idea: Let's commercialize the software and sell to academics and conference organizers
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Likely challenges in building commercial product?

* Think about 2 challenges that the team will likely focus when turning their research into *a product* (business, development, deployment, operation)
* At least one challenge should not be about learning a good ML model, but about *building a product*
* Everybody, **type 2 likely challenges in the chat but *do not send them yet*. Vote "yes" when done.**

## Examples for discussion

* What does correctness or accuracy really mean? What accuracy do customers care about?
* How can we see how well we are doing in practice? How much feedback are customers going to give us before they leave?
* Can we estimate how good our transcriptions are? How are we doing for different customers or different topics?
* How to present results to the customers (including confidence)?
* When customers complain about poor transcriptions, how to prioritize and what to do?
* 
* What are unacceptable mistakes and how can they be avoided? Is there a safety risk?
* Can we cope with an influx of customers?
* Will transcribing the same audio twice produce the same result? Does it matter? 
* How can we debug and fix problems? How quickly?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Examples for discussion 2

* With more customers, transcriptions are taking longer and longer -- what can we do?
* Transcriptions sometimes crash. What to do?
* How do we achieve high availability?
* How can we see that everything is going fine and page somebody if it is not?
* We improve our entity detection model but somehow system behavior degrades... Why?
* Tensorflow update; does our infrastructure still work?
* Once somewhat successful, how to handle large amounts of data per day?
* Buy more machines or move to the cloud?
*
* Models are continuously improved. When to deploy? Can we roll back?
* Can we offer live transcription as an app? As a web service?
* Can we get better the longer a person talks? Should we then go back and reanalyze the beginning? Will this benefit the next upload as well?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Examples for discussion 3

* How many domains can be supported? Do we have the server capacity?
* How specific should domains be? Medical vs "International Conference on Allergy & Immunology"?
* How to make it easy to support new domains?
* 
* Can we handle accents? 
* Better recognition of male than female speakers?
* 
* Can and should we learn from customer data? 
* How can we debug problems on audio files we are not allowed to see?
* Any chance we might private leak customer data? 
* Can competitors or bad actors attack our system?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Recitations

Typically hands on exercises, use tools, analyze cases

Designed to introduce tools and discuss material relevant for assignments

First recitation on Friday: remote work and collaboration + Git
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Grading

* 40% individual assignment
* 30% group project with final presentation
* 10% midterm
* 10% participation
* 10% reading quizzes
* no final exam
*
* expected grade cutoffs: 81-90% B, 91-100% A
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Grading Philosophy

* Specification grading, based in adult learning theory
* Giving you choices in what to work on or how to prioritize your work
* We are making every effort to be clear about expectations (specifications)
* Assignments broken down into expectations with point values, each graded **pass/fail**
* You should be able to tell what grade you will get for an assignment when you submit it, depending on what work you chose to do
* Opportunities to resubmit work until last day of class

[[Example]](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/S2021/assignments/I1_case_study.md#grading)


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Participation

* Participation is important
    - Participation in in-class discussions
    - Active participation in recitations
    - Alternative arrangements if you cannot attend classes live
* Participation != Attendance

* Grading:
  * 100%: Participates at least once in most lectures through chat or audio, or
  * 100%: Participates in 25% of lectures and actively contributes to discussions in most recitations
  * 90%: Participates at least once in over half of the lectures
  * 70%: Participates at least once in 25% of the lectures
  * 40%: Participates at least once in at least 3 lectures or recitations.
  * 0%: No participation in the entire semester.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Flexibility and Accommodations

    - Submit individual assignment 1 day late for 1 token (after running out of tokens 15% penalty per late day)
    - Redo individual assignment for 3 token
    - Resubmit or submit reading quiz late for 1 token
    - Remaining tokens count toward participation
*
* 7 tokens per team:
    - Submit milestone 1 day late for 1 token (no late submissions accepted when out of tokens)
    - Redo milestone for 3 token 

* Exceptions and accommodations on request, email us.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group project

* Instructor-assigned teams
* Teams stay together for project throughout semester, starting next week
* Please fill out survey after class
* Some advice in lecture + we'll help with debugging team issues

## Academic honesty

See web page

In a nutshell: do not copy, do not lie, do not share or publicly release your solutions

In group work, be honest about contributions of team members, do not cover for others

If you feel overwhelmed or stressed, please come and talk to us (see syllabus for other support opportunities)

</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Introductions

Let's go around the "room" for introductions:

* Your (preferred) name
* In two sentences, your data science background and goals
* In two sentences, your software engineering background, if any, and goals
* One topic you are particularly interested in, if any?
