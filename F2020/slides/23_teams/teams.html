(Windows 95: 200 developers and testers, one of 250 products)

* "Synchronize and stabilize"
* For each milestone
    * 6-10 weeks feature development and continuous testing

    * 2-5 weeks buffer

<!-- smallish -->

> As the functional departments grew, staffing the heavily matrixed projects became more and more of a nightmare. To address this, the company reorganized itself into “Studios”, each with dedicated resources for each of the major functional areas reporting up to a Studio manager. Given direct responsibility for performance and compensation, Studio managers could allocate resources freely.

> The Studios were able to exert more direct control on the projects and team members, but not without a cost. The major problem that emerged from Brøderbund’s Studio reorganization was that members of the various functional disciplines began to lose touch with their functional counterparts. Experience wasn’t shared as easily. Over time, duplicate effort began to appear.

* People exerting less effort within a group
* Reasons
    * Diffusion of responsibility
    * Motivation
    * Dispensability of effort / missing recognition
    * Avoid pulling everybody / "sucker effect"
    * Submaximal goal setting
* “Evaluation potential, expectations of co-worker performance, task meaningfulness, and culture had especially strong influence”
