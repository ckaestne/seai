![Airplane](airplane.jpg)

* Automobile: ~30,000 parts; Airplane: ~3,000,000 parts
* MS Office: ~ 40,000,000 LOCs; Debian: ~ 400,000,000 LOCs
* How do we build such complex systems?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Managing Complexity in Software

* **Abstraction**: Hide details & focus on high-level behaviors
* **Reuse**: Package into reusable libraries & APIs with well-defined _contracts_
* **Composition**: Build large components out of smaller ones

```java
class Algorithms {
    /**
     * Finds the shortest distance between to vertices.
	 * This method is only supported for connected vertices.
     */
    int shortestDistance(Graph g, Vertice v1, v2) {…}

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## (Lack of) Modularity in ML

* Often no clear specification of "correct" behavior
  * Optimizing metrics instead of providing guarantees
* Model behavior strongly dependent on training & test sets
  * What happens if distribution changes?
  * Difficult to reuse!
* Poorly understood interactions between models
  * Ideally, develop models separately & compose together
  * In general, must train & tune together

**These problems are not new, but are exacerbated by the increasing
use of ML!**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Resulting Shift in Design Thinking?

From deductive reasoning to inductive reasoning...

From clear specifications to goals...

From guarantees to best effort...

**What does this mean for software engineering?**

**For decomposing software systems?** 

**For correctness of AI-enabled systems?** 

**For safety?**

**For design, implementation, testing, deployment, operations?**

When designing an intelligent experience consider:

* Forcefulness: How strongly to encourage taking an action (or even automate it)?

* Value: How much does a user (think to) benefit from the prediction?
* Cost: What is the damage of a wrong prediction?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Presenting Intelligence: Safe Browsing

![Safe browsing warning](warning.png)

* Compare against more forceful, "automate" option

    one is easier to recover from?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Feedback (Telemetry)

* To design good interactions we need to know how we are doing...
* How many predictions are ignored?
* How many actions are reversed?
* How often does the user ask for extra predictions?
* How much value do users get out of predictions?
* How much are we supporting the system's goals?
* How much cost are wrong predictions causing for users/the system's goals?
* Are mistakes focused on specific kinds of inputs?

<!-- ## Safeguards / Guardrails -->

<!-- * Hard constraints overrule model -->
<!--     - `heat = (temperatureReading < MAX) && continueToasting(...)` -->
<!-- * External hardware or software failsafe mechanisms -->
<!--     - outside the model, external observer, e.g., thermal fuses -->

<!-- ## Other Strategies -->

<!-- * Improve the model, more data, more testing -->
