# Midterm

This semester, the course will have a midterm, but no final exam. 

The midterm will take the place of one lecture, it is 80 minutes. No electronics, but 6 pages of notes (handwritten or printed, both sides, letter size) allowed.

Topic-wise, everything covered in class, in the readings, and in recitation is fair game, though the exam will focus most points on topics where you had some chance to practice (e.g., in assignments, recitation or in-class discussions) not on random recall questions.

## Practice Material

Midterms from previous semesters are available as practice. We expect the midterm to have a similar format, though topic coverage differs slightly between semesters.

* [Practice midterm from Fall 2019](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/F2019/other_material/practice_midterm.pdf) (corresponds quite well to topics covered this semester)
* [Midterm from Fall 2019](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/F2019/other_material/midterm.pdf) (we did not cover version control yet)
* [Final from Fall 2019](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/F2019/other_material/final_exam.pdf) (covers different topics, but provides yet another scenario)
* [Midterm from Summer 2020](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/S2020/exams/midterm.pdf) (slightly fewer topics covered than this semester)
* [Midterm from Fall 2020](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/F2020/exams/midterm_f20.pdf) (similar coverage)
* [Midterm from Spring 2021](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/S2021/exams/) (similar coverage)
* [Midterm from Spring 2022](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/S2022/exams/) (similar coverage, except data quality and infrastructure quality yet)
