# Machine Learning in Software Systems

----
## Machine Learning

Function making predictions for inputs

$f(x_1, x_2, x_3) \rightarrow y$


No specification, function learned by generalizing from example data (inductive reasoning)


----
## Running Example: Transcription Service

![competitor](transcription.png)


----

## The startup idea

PhD research on domain-specific speech recognition, that can detect technical jargon

DNN trained on public PBS interviews + transfer learning on smaller manually annotated domain-specific corpus

Research has shown amazing accuracy for talks in medicine, poverty and inequality research, and talks at Ruby programming conferences; published at top conferences

Idea: Let's commercialize the software and sell to academics and conference organizers

# Accuracy, Correctness, and Other Qualities


----
## Traditional ML Focus: Model Accuracy

* Train and evaluate model on fixed labled data set
* Compare prediction with labels

![Architecture diagram of transcription service; many components, not just ML](transcriptionarchitecture.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

----
## Traditional SE Focus: Functional Correctness

*Given a specification, do outputs match inputs?*

```java
/**
 * compute deductions based on provided adjusted 
 * gross income and expenses in customer data.
 *
 * see tax code 26 U.S. Code A.1.B, PART VI
 */
float computeDeductions(float agi, Expenses expenses);
```

**Each mismatch is considered a bug, should to be fixed*.**

(*=not every bug is economical to fix, may accept some known bugs)



----
## No specification!

We use ML precisely because we do not have a specification (too complex, rules unknown)

We are usually okay with some wrong predictions

> All models are approximations. Assumptions, whether implied or clearly stated, are never exactly true. **All models are wrong, but some models are useful**. So the question you need to ask is not "Is the model true?" (it never is) but "Is the model good enough for this particular application?" -- George Box

## Non-ML Example: Newton's Laws of Motion

> 2nd law: "the rate of change of momentum of a body over time is directly proportional to the force applied, and occurs in the same direction as the applied force" 
> ${\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} }{\mathrm {d} t}}}$

"Newton's laws were verified by experiment and observation for over 200 years, and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life."

Do not generalize for very small scales, very high speeds, or in very strong gravitational fields. Do not explain semiconductor, GPS errors, superconductivity, ... Those require general relativity and quantum field theory.

----
## Limitations of Offline Model Evaluation

* Training and test data drawn from the same population 
    * **i.i.d.: independent and identically distributed**
* Is the population representative of production data?
* If not or only partially or not anymore: Does the model generalize beyond training data?

----
## Testing in Production

----
## Quality concerns for ML-Enabled Systems and components

* Learning time, cost and scalability
* Update cost, incremental learning
* Inference cost
* Size of models learned
* Amount of training data needed
* Fairness
* Robustness
* Safety, security, privacy
* Explainability, reproducibility
* Observability
* Time to market
* Overall operating cost (cost per prediction)

## Discussion: Was the Transcription any good?

* Gather feedback without being intrusive (i.e., labeling outcomes), without harming user experience
* What data can we collect to evaluate our transcription service?
    - Evaluate business goals
    - Evaluate system quality
    - Evaluate model quality

<!-- discussion -->


----
## Typical Telemetry Strategies

* Wait and see
* Ask users
* Manual/crowd-source labeling, shadow execution
* Allow users to complain
* Observe user reaction

Notes:
Expect only sparse feedback and expect negative feedback over-proportionally

----
## Manually Label Production Samples

Similar to labeling learning and testing data, have human annotators

## Discussion 2: Google Tagging uploaded photos with friends' names

* Gather feedback without being intrusive (i.e., labeling outcomes), without harming user experience
* What data can we collect to evaluate our transcription service?
    - Evaluate business goals
    - Evaluate system quality
    - Evaluate model quality


<!-- discussion -->


----
## Monitoring Model Quality in Production

* Monitor model quality together with other quality attributes (e.g., uptime, response time, load)
* Set up automatic alerts when model quality drops
* Watch for jumps after releases
    - roll back after negative jump
* Watch for slow degradation
    - Stale models, data drift, feedback loops, adversaries
* Debug common or important problems
    - Monitor characteristics of requests 
    - Mistakes uniform across populations?
    - Challenging problems -> refine training, add regression tests

## Model Quality vs System Quality

![Model accuracy does not need to correlate with business metric](bookingcom2.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" --> 

**Possible causes?**

Bernardi et al. "150 successful machine learning models: 6 lessons learned at Booking.com." In Proc KDD, 2019.

Note: hypothesized 
* model value saturated, little more value to be expected
* segment saturation: only very few users benefit from further improvement
* overoptimization on proxy metrics not real target metrics
* uncanny valley effect from "creepy AIs"

## Engineering Challenges for Telemetry
![Amazon news story](alexa.png)

----
## Engineering Challenges for Telemetry
* Data volume and operating cost
    - e.g., record "all AR live translations"?
    - reduce data through sampling
    - reduce data through summarization (e.g., extracted features rather than raw data; extraction client vs server side)
* Adaptive targeting
* Biased sampling
* Rare events
* Privacy
* Offline deployments?


----
## Exercise: Design Telemetry in Production

Discuss: Quality measure, telemetry, operationalization, cost, privacy, rare events
