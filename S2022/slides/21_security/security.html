<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * What does it mean for my system to be secure?
* Threat model
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * What are the attacker's goals, capabilities, and incentives?
* Attack surface

![](cia-triad.png)

* What do we mean by "secure"?
* Common security requirements: "CIA triad" of information security
* __Confidentiality__: Sensitive data must be accessed by authorized users only
* __Integrity__: Sensitive data must be modifiable by authorized users only
* __Availability__: Critical services must be available when needed by clients
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Example: College Admission System

![](admission-hack.png)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Confidentiality, integrity, or availability?

* Applications to the program can only be viewed by staff and faculty
in the department.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* The application site should be able to handle requests on the
day of the application deadline.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Application decisions are recorded only by the faculty and staff.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* The acceptance notices can only be sent out by the program director.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Other Security Requirements 

* Authentication: Users are who they say they are
* Non-repudiation: Certain changes/actions in the system can be traced to who was responsible for it
* Authorization: Only users with the right permissions can access a resource/perform an action

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Why Threat Model?

![](gate.png)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## What is Threat Modeling?

* Threat model: A profile of an attacker
  * __Goal__: What is the attacker trying to achieve?
  * __Capability__:
	* Knowledge: What does the attacker know?
	* Actions: What can the attacker do?
	* Resources: How much effort can it spend? 
  * __Incentive__: Why does the attacker want to do this?

![](art-of-war.png)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Attacker Goal

* What is the attacker trying to achieve?
  * Typically, undermine one or more security requirements
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Example: College admission
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Access other applicants info without being authorized
	<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Modify application status to “accepted”
	<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Cause website shutdown to sabotage other applicants
	<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Attacker Capability

![](admission-threat-model.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* What actions are available to the attacker (to achieve its goal)?
  * Depends on system boundary & interfaces exposed to external actors
  * Use an architecture diagram to identify attack surface & actions

<!-- ---- -->
<!-- ## Architecture Diagram for Threat Modeling -->

<!-- ![](admission-threat-model.jpg) -->

<!-- * You can use any notation, as long as: -->
<!--   * its constructs (e.g., boxes and lines) have clear meanings; use legend! -->
<!--   * it clearly shows potentially malicious/untrusted agent(s) & interactions -->
<!--     with the system -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## STRIDE Threat Modeling

![](stride.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* A systematic approach to identifying threats (i.e., attacker actions)
  * Construct an architectural diagram with components & connections
  * Designate the trust boundary 
  * For each untrusted component/connection, identify potential threats
  * For each potential threat, devise a mitigation strategy

<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* Spoofing: Attacker pretends to be another applicant by logging in -> __Require stronger passwords__
* Tampering: Attacker modifies applicant info using browser exploits -> __Add server-side security tokens__
* Information disclosure: Attacker intercepts HTTP requests from/to server to read applicant info -> __Use encryption (HTTPS)__
* Denial of service: Attacker creates many bogus accounts and overwhelms system with requests -> __Limit requests per IP address__
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## STRIDE & Other Threat Modeling Methods

![](stride.png)

* A systematic approach to identifying threats & attacker actions
* Limitations:
  * May end up with a long list of threats, not all of them critical
  * False sense of security: STRIDE does not imply completeness!
* Consider cost vs. benefit trade-offs: Implementing mitigations add
    to development cost and complexity

* Availability: Inject mislabeled training data to damage model

  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * 3% poisoning => 11% decrease in accuracy (Steinhardt, 2017)
* Attacker must have some access to the training set

* See [counterfactual explanations](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/F2020/slides/17_explainability/explainability.html#/7/1)
* Find similar inputs with different predictions
  - Can be targeted (specific prediction) or  untargeted (any wrong prediction)
* Many similarity measures (e.g., change one feature vs small changes to many features) 
  - $x^* = x + arg min \\{ |\epsilon| : f(x+\epsilon)  \neq f(x) \\}$
* Attacks more effective with access to model internals, but black-box
  attacks also feasible 
  - With model internals: Follow the model's gradient
  - Without model internals: Learn [surrogate model](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/F2020/slides/17_explainability/explainability.html#/6/2)
  - With access to confidence scores: Heuristic search (e.g., hill climbing)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Model Inversion: Confidentiality

![](model-inversion-image.png)

* Given a model output (e.g., name of a person), infer the
corresponding, potentially sensitive input (facial image of the
person)
* One method: Gradient descent on input space
  * Assumes that the model produces a confidence score for prediction
  * Start with a random input vector & iterate towards input values
    with higher confidence level

Countermeasures_, M. Fredrikson et al. in CCS (2015).
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Defense against Model Inversion Attacks

![](differential-privacy-example.png)

* Limit attacker access to confidence scores
  * e.g., reduce the precision of the scores by rounding them off
  * But also reduces the utility of legitimate use of these scores!
* Differential privacy in ML
	* Limit what attacker can learn about the model (e.g., parameters)
      based on an individual training sample
	* Achieved by adding noise to input or output (e.g., DP-SGD)
	* More noise => higher privacy, but also lower model accuracy!

![](security-phone.jpg)

* Assume that all components may be compromised at one point or

  failures from attacks

*  Goal: Minimize the impact of a compromised component on the rest of
the system

* Principle of least privilege
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * A component should be given the minimal privileges needed to fulfill its functionality
* Isolation/compartmentalization
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
