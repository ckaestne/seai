* **Infrastructure:** Understand chat bot infrastructure and its capabilities
* **Knowing topics:** Identify what users talk about, train/test concepts with past chat logs
  * "*We fed VocabX a line deliberately trying to confuse it. We wrote, ‘I am thinking about chapter 13 in Boston divorce filing.’ VocabX figured out the two topics: (1) business and industrial/company/bankruptcy (2) society/social institution/divorce.*"

* **Guiding conversations:** Supporting open-ended conversations requires detecting what's on topic and finding a good response; intent-topic modeling
  * *Is talk about parents and children on topic when discussing divorce?*
  * Data gathering/labeling very challenging -- too many corner cases
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Stepping Back: System Goals

What are the goals of the system?

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Status meeting with (inhouse) Customer

<!-- smallish -->
The chatbot performed better than before but was far from ready for deployment. There were “too many edge cases” in which conversations did not go as planned. 

**Customer:** "Maybe we need to think about it like an 80/20 rule. In some cases, it works well, but for some, it is harder. 80% everything is fine, and in the remaining 20%, we try to do our best."

**Data science lead:** The trouble is how to automatically recognize what is 80 and what is 20.

**Customer:** I agree. Let us focus on that. We just want value. Tech is secondary.

**Data scientist:** It is harder than it sounds. One of the models is a matching model trained on pairs of legal questions and answers. 60,000 of them. It seems large but is small for ML.

**Customer:** That’s a lot. Can it answer a question about say visa renewal?

**Data scientist:** If there exists a question like that in training data, then yes. But with just 60,000, the model can easily overfit, and then for anything outside, it would just fail.

**Customer:** I see what you are saying. Edge cases are interesting from an academic perspective, but for a business the first and foremost thing is value. You are trying to solve an interesting problem. I get it. But I feel that you may have already solved it enough to gain business value.

</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## System Goal for Chatbot

* Collect user data to sell to lawyers
* Signal technical competency to lawyers
* Acceptable to fail: Too complicated for self-help, connect with lawyer
* Solving edge cases not important

> "Edge cases are important, but the end goal is user information, monetizing user data. We are building a legal self-help chatbot, but a major business use case is to tell people: ‘here, talk to this lawyer.’ We do want to connect them with a lawyer. Even for 20%, when our bot fails, we tell users that the problem cannot be done through self-help. Let us get you a lawyer, right? That is what we wanted in the first place."

* "Good enough" may be good enough
* Prediction critical for system success or just an gimmick?
* Better predictions may come at excessive costs 
    - need way more data, much longer training times
    - privacy concerns
* Better user interface ("experience") may mitigate many problems
    - e.g. explain decisions to users
* Use only high-confidence predictions?

* 2012 essay lamenting focus on algorithmic improvements and benchmarks in ML
  - focus on standard benchmark sets, not engaging with problem: Iris classification, digit recognition, ...
  - focus on abstract metrics, not measuring real-world impact: accuracy, ROC
  - distant from real-world concerns

* **ML-Enabled Systems**, *Production ML Systems*, *AI-Enabled Systems*,  or *ML-Infused Systems*; *SE4AI*, *SE4ML*
* sometimes **AI Engineering** -- but usually used with a ML-pipeline focus
* **MLOps** ~ technical infrastructure automating ML pipelines
* sometimes **ML Systems Engineering** -- but often this refers to building distributed and scalable ML and data storage platforms
* "AIOps" ~ using AI to make automated decisions in operations; "DataOps" ~ use of agile methods and automation in business data analytics
* My preference: **Production Systems with Machine-Learning Components**

* Rarely robust infrastructure, often monolithic and tangled
* Challenges in deploying systems and integration with monitoring, streams etc
* 
* Shifting to pipeline-centric workflow challenging

</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Weak Correctness Assumptions

* Often no reliable ground truth (e.g. human judgment)
* Accepting that mistakes will happen, hopefully not to frequently; "95% accuracy" may be pretty good
* More confident for data similar to training data

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Specifications in Machine Learning?

* Usually clear specifications do not exist -- we use machine learning exactly because we do not know the specifications
* Can define correctness for some data, but not general rules; sometimes can only determine correctness after the fact
* Learning for tasks for which we cannot write specifications
  * Too complex
  * Rules unknown
* ML will learn rules/specifications (inductive reasoning), often not in a human-readable form, but are those the right ones?
* 
* Usually goals used instead --> maximize a specific objective

## Deductive Reasoning

* Combining logical statements following agreed upon rules to form new statements
* Proving theorems from axioms
* From general to the particular
* *mathy reasoning, eg. proof that π is irrational*
* 
* Formal methods, classic rule-based AI systems, expert systems

<!-- split -->

## Inductive Reasoning

* Constructing axioms from observations
* Strong evidence suggests a rule
* From particular to the general
* *sciency reasoning, eg. finding laws of nature*
* 
* Most modern machine learning systems, statistical learning

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Takeaway: Shift in Design Thinking?

Breaking traditional decomposition and reasoning strategies... 

From deductive reasoning to inductive reasoning...

From clear specifications to goals...

From guarantees to best effort...

**What does this mean for software engineering?**

**For decomposing software systems?** 

**For correctness of AI-enabled systems?** 

**For safety?**

**For design, implementation, testing, deployment, operations?**


*These problems are not new, but are exacerbated by the increasing use of ML!*
























</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Summary

* Production AI-enabled systems require a *whole system perspective*, beyond just the model or the pipeline
* Distinguish system goals from model goals
* Quality at a *system* level: safety beyond the model, beyond accuracy
* Plan for operations (telemetry, updates)
* Large design space for user interface (intelligent experience): forcefulness, frequency, telemetry
