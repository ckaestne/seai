* Unrealistic or missing assumptions
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* e.g., poorly understood effect of weather conditions on sensor accuracy,

* Concept drift
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Environment evolves over time; underlying distribution changes
  * e.g. user's preferences on products
  * (More on this in the data quality lecture)
* Adversaries 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * A malicious actor deliberately tries to violate assumptions
  * e.g., adversarial attacks on stop signs
  * (More in the security lecture)
* Feedback loops

    earlier assumptions may cease to hold

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Process for Establishing Requirements

1. Identify environmental entities and machine components
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. State a desired requirement (REQ) over the environment

3. Identify the interface between the environment & machine
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. Identify the environmental assumptions (ENV)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
5. Develop specifications (SPEC) that are sufficient to establish REQ
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
6. Check whether ENV ∧ SPEC ⊧ REQ
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
7. If not, go back to the beginning & repeat

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Takeaway

* Software/ML models alone cannot fulfill system requirements
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * They are just one part of the system, and have limited control
    over the environment
* Environmental assumptions are just as critical in achieving requirements
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * If you ignore/misunderstand these, your system may fail or do poorly (no matter how good your model is)
  * Identify and document these assumptions as early as possible!
  * Some of the assumptions may be violated over time as the environment
  changes
	  * Monitor these assumptions and adjust your specification
        accordingly

</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Summary

* Requirements state the needs of the stakeholders and are expressed
  over the phenomena in the environment
* Software/ML models have limited influence over the environment
* Environmental assumptions play just as an important role in
establishing requirements
