<!-- ![](fairness-accuracy.jpeg) -->
![](bongo.gif)

* "Impossibility Theorem": Can't satisfy multiple fairness criteria at
  once
* Easy to pick some definition & claim that the model is fair
  * But does a "fair" model really help reduce harm in the long term?
* Instead of trying to "fix" bias through a model, can we understand &
  address the root causes of bias in the first place?
  * Many of these are deeply rooted in our society, and
    can't be solved purely through technical means!
