![](word-funny.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* Mental and physical effort needed to perform a desired task

</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Modes of Interaction
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Modes of Interaction

* Automate: Take action on user's behalf
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Augment: Provide options or additional information
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Prompt: Ask the user if an action should be taken
  * Organize: Display a set of items in an order
  * Annotate: Add information to a display
* Hybrid of above
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Selecting Appropriate Mode of Interaction

* Identify the tasks that the user wants to achieve
* For each task, decide between __automate vs. augment__ 
* Automate when:
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * User lacks knowledge/ability to perform the task (e.g., prediction)
    <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Boring, repetitive, dangerous tasks
    <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * The effect of action can be reversed
    <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Augment when:
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * High stakes & accountability is needed
     <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Difficult to communicate the user's need to AI
     <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * User enjoys performing the task (e.g., driving)
     <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Other Factors to Consider

* Forcefulness: How strongly to encourage taking an action?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Active: Automate action or interrupt user and ask for confirmation
	* Passive: Suggest action, but do not require immediate answer
* Frequency: How often does interaction occur?	
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* When a new prediction is available or model changes
	* Periodically (e.g., suggest action every hour)
	* Only when explicitly initiated by user 
* Cost: What is the effect of a wrong prediction?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* If cost is too high, consider augmenting rather than automating
	* If possible, provide a way to undo the action of AI
