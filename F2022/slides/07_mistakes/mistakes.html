Humans often make predicable mistakes
  * most mistakes near to correct answer, distribution of mistakes

ML models may be wildly wrong when they are wrong
   - especially black box models may use (spurious) correlations humans would never think about
   - may be very confident about wrong answer
   - "fixing" one mistake may cause others

No model is every "correct"

Some mistakes are unavoidable

Anticipate the eventual mistake
* Make the system safe despite mistakes
* Consider the rest of the system (software + environment)
* Example: Thermal fuse in smart toaster

<div class="small">

* Fault tree: A top-down diagram that displays the relationships
between a system failure (i.e., requirement violation) and its potential causes.  
  * Identify sequences of events that result in a failure
  * Prioritize the contributors leading to the failure

*Cut set:* A set of basic events whose simultaneous occurrence is

obtained by removing a basic event.

To compute the probability of the top event:
  * Assign probabilities to basic events (based on domain knowledge)
  * Apply probability theory to compute probabilities of intermediate events
	through AND & OR gates
  * (Alternatively, as sum of prob. of minimal cut sets) 

In this class, we won't ask you to do this.

<div class="smallish">

1. Specify the system structure
   * Environment entities & machine components
   * Assumptions (ASM) & specifications (SPEC)
2. Identify the top event as a requirement violation (REQ)
3. Construct the fault tree
	* Derive intermediate events from a violation of ENV or SPEC
	* Decompose the intermediate events further down based on the knowledge of the domain or components
4. Analyze the tree, Identify all possible minimal cut sets
5. Consider design modifications
   * Eliminate certain cutsets, or
   * Increase the size of min cutsets
6. Repeat

<!-- colstart -->

<div class="small">

Specification: EB must apply a maximum braking command to the engine.

  * __NO OR NOT__: EB does not generate any braking command.
  * __LESS__: EB applies less than max. braking.
  * __LATE__: EB applies max. braking but after a delay of 2
  seconds.
  * __REVERSE__: EB generates an acceleration command instead of braking.
  * __BEFORE__: EB applies max. braking before a possible crash is detected.

Using HAZOP: As a group answer in `#lecture`, tagging group members:

>  * What is the specification of the perception component? 
>  * What are possible deviations from the specification?
>  * What are potential hazards resulting from these deviations?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## HAZOP: Benefits & Limitations

* Easy to use; encourages systematic reasoning about component faults
* Can be combined with FTA/FMEA to generate faults (i.e., basic
events in FTA)
* Potentially labor-intensive; relies on engineer's judgement
* Does not guarantee to find all hazards (but also true for other techniques)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Remarks: Hazard Analysis

None of these methods guarantee completeness
  * You may still be missing important hazards, failure modes

Intended as structured approaches to thinking about failures
  * But cannot replace human expertise and experience














</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Summary

* Accept that a failure is inevitable
  * ML components will eventually make mistakes, reasons barely matter
  * Environment may evolve over time, violating assumptions
* Design strategies for mitigating mistakes
  * Human in the loop, Undoable actions, Guardrails, Mistake detection and recovery (monitoring, doer-checker, fail-over, redundancy), Containment and isolation
* Use risk analysis to identify and mitigate potential problems
