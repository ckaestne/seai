* Explain the oracle problem and how it challenges testing of software and models
* Use invariants to check partial model properties with automated testing
* Select and deploy automated infrastructure to evaluate and monitor model quality
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Model Quality


**First Part:** Measuring Prediction Accuracy

**Third Part:** Learning from Software Testing 🠔
* unit testing, test case curation, invariants, simulation (next lecture)

<div class="small">

Write a few tests for the following program:

```scala
def nextDate(year: Int, month: Int, day: Int) = ...
```

A test may look like:
```java
assert nextDate(2021, 2, 8) == (2021, 2, 9);
```

**As a group, discuss how you select tests. Discuss how many tests you need to feel confident.**

* Test consists of
    - Controlled environment

leap days and month lengths) or can focus on implementation</p>
<p>Will not randomly sample from distribution of all days</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Software Test Case Design

<div class="smallish">

**Opportunistic/exploratory testing:** Add some unit tests, without much planning

**Specification-based testing** ("black box"): Derive test cases from specifications
  - Boundary value analysis
  - Equivalence classes
  - Combinatorial testing
  - Random testing

**Structural testing** ("white box"): Derive test cases to cover implementation paths
  - Line coverage, branch coverage
  - Control-flow, data-flow testing, MCDC, ...

Test execution usually automated, but can be manual too; automated generation from specifications or code possible

</div>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Example: Boundary Value Testing

Analyze the specification, not the implementation!

**Key Insight:** Errors often occur at the boundaries of a variable value

For each variable select (1) minimum, (2) min+1, (3) medium, (4) max-1, and (5) maximum; possibly also invalid values min-1, max+1
 
Example: `nextDate(2015, 6, 13) = (2015, 6, 14)`
  - **Boundaries?**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Example: Equivalence classes

**Idea:** Typically many values behave similarly, but some groups of values are different

Equivalence classes derived from specifications (e.g., cases, input ranges, error conditions, fault models)

Example `nextDate(2015, 6, 13)`
  - leap years, month with 28/30/31 days, days 1-28, 29, 30, 31

Pick 1 value from each group, combine groups from all variables

/** Compute the price of a bus ride:
 *  - Children under 2 ride for free, children under 18 and 
 *    senior citizen over 65 pay half, all others pay the

 *  - On weekdays, between 7am and 9am and between 4pm and

* Credit rating should not depend on gender:
    - $\forall x. f(x[\text{gender} \leftarrow \text{male}]) = f(x[\text{gender} \leftarrow \text{female}])$
* Synonyms should not change the sentiment of text:
    - $\forall x. f(x) = f(\texttt{replace}(x, \text{"is not", "isn't"}))$
* Negation should swap meaning:
    - $\forall x \in \text{"X is Y"}. f(x) = 1-f(\texttt{replace}(x, \text{" is ", " is not "}))$
* Robustness around training data:
    - $\forall x \in \text{training data}. \forall y \in \text{mutate}(x, \delta). f(x) = f(y)$
* Low credit scores should never get a loan (sufficient conditions for classification, "anchors"):

Formal description of relationships among inputs and outputs (*Metamorphic Relations*)

In general, for a model $f$ and inputs $x$ define two functions to transform inputs and outputs $g\_I$ and $g\_O$ such that:

$\forall x. f(g\_I(x)) = g\_O(f(x))$

<!-- vspace -->

e.g. $g\_I(x)= \texttt{replace}(x, \text{" is ", " is not "})$ and $g\_O(x)=\neg x$


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## On Testing with Invariants/Assertions

* Defining good metamorphic relations requires knowledge of the problem domain
* Good metamorphic relations focus on parts of the system
* Invariants usually cover only one aspect of correctness -- maybe capabilities
* Invariants and near-invariants can be mined automatically from sample data (see *specification mining* and *anchors*)

* Generating sample inputs is easy, but knowing corresponding outputs is not (oracle problem)
* Crashing bugs are not a concern
* Invariants + generated data can check capabilities or properties (metamorphic testing)
  - Inputs can be generated realistically or to find violations (adversarial learning)
* If inputs can be computed from outputs, tests can be automated (simulation-based testing)

* Several coverage metrics have been proposed
    - All path of a decision tree? 
    - All neurons activated at least once in a DNN? (several papers "neuron coverage")
    - Linear regression models??
* Often create artificial inputs, not realistic for distribution
* Unclear whether those are useful
* Adversarial learning techniques usually more efficient at finding invariant violations
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Regression Testing

* Whenever bug detected and fixed, add a test case
* Make sure the bug is not reintroduced later
* Execute test suite after changes to detect regressions
    - Ideally automatically with continuous integration tools
*
* Maps well to curating test sets for important populations in ML
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Mutation Analysis

* Start with program and passing test suite
* Automatically insert small modifications ("mutants") in the source code
    - `a+b` -> `a-b`
    - `a<b` -> `a<=b`
    - ...
* Can program detect modifications ("kill the mutant")?
* Better test suites detect more modifications ("mutation score")

```java
int divide(int A, int B) {
  if (A==0)     // A!=0, A<0, B==0
    return 0;   // 1, -1
  if (B==0)     // B!=0, B==1
    return -1;  // 0, -2
  return A / B; // A*B, A+B

assert(1, divide(1,1));
assert(0, divide(0,1));
assert(-1, divide(1,0));
```
