<!-- smallish -->

* 62% of interviewees were not aware of curation algorithm
* Surprise and anger when learning about curation

> "Participants were most upset when close friends and
family were not shown in their feeds [...] participants often attributed missing stories to their friends’ decisions to exclude them rather than to Facebook News Feed algorithm."

* Learning about algorithm did not change satisfaction level
* More active engagement, more feeling of control

* Protecting models akin to "security by obscurity"
* *Good models rely on hard facts that relate causally to the outcome <- hard to game*

* accountability, responsibility, liability, and culpability all overlap in common use
* all about assigning *blame* -- responsible for fixing or liable for paying for damages
* liability, culpability have *legal* connotation
* accountability, responsibility tend to describe *ethical* aspirations
* see legal vs ethical earlier

![Random letters](../_assets/onterminology.jpg)<!-- .element: class="cornerimg" -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## On Terminology

Academic definition of accountability:

> A relationship between an **actor** and a **forum**,
in which the actor has an obligation to explain
and to justify his or her conduct, the forum can
pose questions and pass judgement, and the
actor **may face consequences**.

That is accountability implies some oversight with ability to penalize

* Continuous learning
* Consider controlling/restricting how software may be used, whether it should be built at all
