![Feature Encoding](featureencoding.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

*Should feature encoding happen server-side or client-side? Tradeoffs?*

<aside class="notes"><p>When thinking of model inference as a component within a system, feature encoding can happen with the model-inference component or can be the responsibility of the client. That is, the client either provides the raw inputs (e.g., image files; dotted box in the figure above) to the inference service or the client is responsible for computing features and provides the feature vector to the inference service (dashed box). Feature encoding and model inference could even be two separate services that are called by the client in sequence. Which alternative is preferable is a design decision that may depend on a number of factors, for example, whether and how the feature vectors are stored in the system, how expensive computing the feature encoding is, how often feature encoding changes, how many models use the same feature encoding, and so forth. For instance, in our stock photo example, having feature encoding being part of the inference service is convenient for clients and makes it easy to update the model without changing clients, but we would have to send the entire image over the network instead of just the much smaller feature vector for the reduced 300 x 300 pixels.</p>
