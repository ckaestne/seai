**Infrastructure:** Understand chat bot infrastructure and its capabilities

**Knowing topics:** Identify what users talk about, train/test concepts with past chat logs
  * "*We fed VocabX a line deliberately trying to confuse it. We wrote, ‘I am thinking about chapter 13 in Boston divorce filing.’ VocabX figured out the two topics: (1) business and industrial/company/bankruptcy (2) society/social institution/divorce.*"

**Guiding conversations:** Supporting open-ended conversations requires detecting what's on topic and finding a good response; intent-topic modeling
  * *Is talk about parents and children on topic when discussing divorce?*
  * Data gathering/labeling very challenging -- too many corner cases

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Status meeting with (inhouse) Customer

<div class="small">

The chatbot performed better than before but was far from ready for deployment. There were “too many edge cases” in which conversations did not go as planned. 

> **Customer:** "Maybe we need to think about it like an 80/20 rule. In some cases, it works well, but for some, it is harder. 80% everything is fine, and in the remaining 20%, we try to do our best."
>
> **Data science lead:** The trouble is how to automatically recognize what is 80 and what is 20.
>
> **Data scientist:** It is harder than it sounds. One of the models is a matching model trained on pairs of legal questions and answers. 60,000 of them. It seems large but is small for ML.
>
> **Customer:** That’s a lot. Can it answer a question about say visa renewal?
>
> **Data scientist:** If there exists a question like that in training data, then yes. But with just 60,000, the model can easily overfit, and then for anything outside, it would just fail.
>
> **Customer:** I see what you are saying. Edge cases are interesting from an academic perspective, but for a business the first and foremost thing is value. You are trying to solve an interesting problem. I get it. But I feel that you may have already solved it enough to gain business value.

We are building a legal self-help chatbot, but a major business use case is to tell people: ‘here, talk to this lawyer.’ We do want to connect them with a lawyer.
