Clear specifications are available 

Simple heuristics are *good enough*

Cost of building and maintaining the ML system outweighs its
benefits (see the [technical debt paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub43146.pdf))

Correctness is of utmost importance

ML is used only for the hype (e.g., to attract funding)

**Examples of these?**

<aside class="notes"><p>Heuristics: Filtering out profanity in languages</p>
<p>Tasks that are done infrequently or once in a while</p>
<p>Accounting systems, inventory tracking, physics simulations, safety railguards, fly-by-wire</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Consider Non-ML Baselines

Consider simple heuristics -- how far can you get? 

Consider semi-manual approaches -- cost and benefit? 

Consider the system without that feature 

Examples: 
  - Recommending products on Amazon
  - Filtering comments with profanity on public forums
  - Credit card fraud detection
  - Controlling a washing machine
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## When to use Machine Learning

**Big problems:** Many inputs, massive scale

**Open-ended problems:** No single "final" solution; incremental
  improvements and growth over time

**Time-changing problems:** Adapting to constant changes, learning with users

**Intrinsically hard problems:** Unclear rules, heuristics perform poorly

**Examples?**

<!-- references -->
see Hulten, Chapter 2
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Additional Considerations for ML

Partial solution is acceptable: Mistakes are acceptable or mitigable

Data for continuous improvement is available

Predictions can have an influence on system objectives: Does it
  actually contribute to organizational objectives?

Cost effective: Cheaper than other approaches, or benefits clearly
  outweigh costs

**Examples?**

* predictions are critical input to decision making (not necessarily full automation) 
* decreased price in predictions makes them more attractive for more tasks 
* increases the value of data and data science experts 
* decreases the value of human prediction and other substitutes 
* decreased cost and increased accuracy in prediction can fundamentally change business strategies and transform organizations

![Taxi in London](taxi.jpg) 
<!-- .element: class="stretch" --> 

<aside class="notes"><p>Cab drivers in London invested 3 years to learn streets to predict the fasted route. Navigation tools get close or better at low cost per prediction. While drivers&#39; skills don&#39;t degrade, they now compete with many others that use AI to enhance skills; human prediction no longer scarce commodity. </p>
<p>At the same time, the value of human judgement increases. Making more decisions with better inputs, specifying the objective. </p>

</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Predictions vs Judgement 

Predictions are an input to decision making under uncertainty 

Making the decision requires judgement (determining relative payoffs of decisions and outcomes) 

Judgement often left to humans ("value function engineering") 

ML may learn to predict human judgment if enough data 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Automation with predictions 


* Automated predictions scale much better than human ones 
* Automating prediction vs predict judgement 
* Value from full and partial automation, even with humans still required 
* Highest return with full automation 
    - Tasks already mostly automated, except predictions (e.g. mining) 
    - Increased speed through automation (e.g., autonomous driving) 
    - Reduction in wait time (e.g., space exploration) 
* Liability concerns may require human involvement 

*Automated decisions desirable but not necessary*
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## The Cost and Value of Data 

* (1) Data for training, (2) input data for decisions, (3) telemetry data for continued improving 
* Collecting and storing data can be costly (direct and indirect costs, including reputation/privacy) 
* Diminishing returns of data: at some point, even more data has limited benefits 
* Return on investment: investment in data vs improvement in prediction accuracy 
* May need constant access to data to update models 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Where to use AI? 

* Decompose tasks to identify the use of (or potential use of) predictions 
* Estimate the benefit of better/cheaper predictions 
* Specify exact prediction task: goals/objectives, data  
* Seek automation opportunities, analyze effects on jobs (augmentation, automate steps, shift skills, see taxis) 
* Focus on steps with highest return on investment 

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Cost Per Prediction 

*What contributes to the average cost of a single prediction?* 

Examples: Music recommendation, credit card fraud detection, product recommendations on Amazon 

<!-- discussion --> 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Cost Per Prediction 

* Useful conceptual measure, factoring in all costs 
    - Development cost 
    - Data acquisition 
    - Learning cost, retraining cost 
    - Operating cost 
    - Debugging and service cost 
    - Possibly: Cost of deadling with incorrect prediction consequences (support, manual interventions, liability)

<div class="smallish">

*Innate/overall goals of the organization*

* Business
    * Current/future revenue, profit
    * Reduce business risks
* Non-Profits
    - Lives saved, animal welfare increased, CO2 reduced, fires averted
    - Social justice improved, well-being elevated, fairness improved
* Often not directly measurable from system output; slow indicators

**Implication: Accurate ML models themselves are not the ultimate goal!**

**ML may only indirectly influence such organizational
  objectives; influence is often hard to quantify; lagging measures**

</div>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Leading Indicators

<div class="smallish">

*Measures correlating with future success, from the business perspective*




Examples: 
* Customers sentiment: Do they like the product? (e.g., surveys, ratings)
* Customer engagement: How often do they use the product?
  * Regular use, time spent on site, messages posted
  * Growing user numbers, recommendations

Caveats
  * Often indirect, proxy measures
  * Can be misleading (e.g., more daily active users => higher profits?)

</div>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## System Goals

*Concrete outputs the system should produce*

Relates to system requirements

Examples:
* Detect cancer in radiology scans
* Provide and recommend music to stream
* Provide legal help with a self-service chatbot

*How well the system is serving its users, from the user's perspective*

Examples: 
  * Users choosing recommended items and enjoying them
  * Users making better decisions
  * Users saving time thanks to the system
  * Users achieving their goals

Easier and more granular to measure, but possibly only indirect relation to organization/system objectives

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Model Goals

*Quality of the model used in a system, from the model's perspective*

* Model accuracy
* Rate and kinds of mistakes
* Successful user interactions

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## What is Measurement?

> Measurement is the empirical, objective assignment of numbers,
according to a rule derived from a model or theory, to attributes of
objects or events with the intent of describing them. – Craner, Bond,
“Software Engineering Metrics: What Do They Measure and How Do We
Know?"

>  A quantitatively expressed reduction of uncertainty based on one or more observations. – Hubbard, “How to Measure Anything …"

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Everything is Measurable

<div class="smallish">

1. If X is something we care about, then X, by definition, must be
detectable.
    * How could we care about things like “quality,” “risk,” “security,” or “public image” if these things were totally undetectable, directly or indirectly?
    * If we have reason to care about some unknown quantity, it is because we think it corresponds to desirable or undesirable results in some way.
2. If X is detectable, then it must be detectable in some amount.
	* If you can observe a thing at all, you can observe more of it or less of it
3. If we can observe it in some amount, then it must be measurable.


*But: Not every measure is precise, not every measure is cost effective*

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## On Terminology

* **Quantification** is turning observations into numbers
* **Metric** and **measure** refer a method or standard format for measuring something (e.g., number of mistakes per hour)
  - Metric and measure synonymous for our purposes (some distinguish metrics as derived from multiple measures, or metrics to be standardizes measures)
* **Operationalization** is identifying and implementing a method to
  measure some factor (e.g., identifying mistakes from telemetry log file)

## Measurement in Software Engineering

* Which project to fund?
* Need more system testing?
* Need more training?
* Fast enough? Secure enough? 
* Code quality sufficient?
* Which features to focus on?
* Developer bonus?
* Time and cost estimation? 
<!-- col -->

## Measurement in Data Science

* Which model is more accurate?
* Does my model generalize or overfit?
* How noisy is my training data?
* Is my model fair?
* Is my model robust?

<!-- colend -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Measurement Scales

<div class="small">

* Scale: Type of data being measured; dictates what analysis/arithmetic is meaningful
* Nominal: Categories ($=, \neq$, frequency, mode, ...)
  * e.g., biological species, film genre, nationality
* Ordinal: Order, but no meaningful magnitude ($<, >$, median, rank correlation, ...)
  * Difference between two values is not meaningful
  * Even if numbers are used, they do not represent magnitude!
  * e.g., weather severity, complexity classes in algorithms
* Interval: Order, magnitude, but no definition of zero ($+, -$, mean, variance, ...)
  * 0 is an arbitrary point; does not represent absence of quantity
  * Ratio between values are not meaningful
  * e.g., temperature (C or F)
* Ratio: Order, magnitude, and zero ($*, /, log, \sqrt{\ }$, geometric mean)
  * e.g., mass, length, temperature (Kelvin)
* Understand scales of features and use an appropriate encoding for
  learning algorithms!
  * e.g., One-hot encoding for nominal features

For design strategy, see [Goal-Question-Metric approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQM)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Stating Measures Precisely

<div class="smallish">

* Always be precise about metrics
    - "measure accuracy" -> "evaluate accuracy with MAPE"
    - "evaluate test quality" -> "measure branch coverage with Jacoco"
    - "measure execution time" -> "average and 90%-quantile response time for REST-API x under normal load"
    - "assess developer skills" -> "measure average lines of code produced per day and number of bugs reported on code produced by that developer"
    - "measure customer happiness" -> "report response rate and average customer rating on survey shown to 2% of all customers (randomly selected)"
* Ideally: An independent party should be able to independently set up infrastructure to measure outcomes

</div>

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Measuring

Three ingredients:
1. **Measure:** What do we try to capture?
2. **Data collection:** What data is collected and how?
3. **Operationalization:** How is the measure computed from the data?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Example: Measuring for Spotify Goals?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Risks with Measurements

**Bad statistics:** A basic misunderstanding of measurement theory and what is being measured.

**Bad decisions:** The incorrect use of measurement data, leading to unintended side effects.

**Bad incentives:** Disregard for the human factors, or how the cultural change of taking measurements will affect people.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Measurement Validity

<div class="smallish">

**Construct validity:** Are we measuring what we intended to measure?
  * Does the abstract concept match the specific scale/measurement used?
  * e.g., IQ: What is it actually measuring?
  * Other examples: Pain, language proficiency, personality...

**Predictive validity:** The extent to which the measurement can be used to explain some other characteristic of the entity being measured
* e.g., Higher SAT scores => higher academic excellence?

**External validity:** Concerns the generalization of the findings to contexts and environments, other than the one studied
* e.g., Drug effectiveness on a test group: Does it hold over the general public?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">##  Correlation vs Causation

<div class="smallish">


In general, ML learns correlation, not causation
  * (exception: Bayesian networks, certain symbolic AI methods)
  * For more details: See [causal inference](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/08/31/7-causality/)

Be careful about interpretation & intervention based on correlations
  * e.g., positive correlation between exercise and skin cancer
  * Exercise less => reduce chance of skin cancer?

To establish causality:
  * Develop a theory ("X causes Y") based on domain knowledge & indep. data
  * Identify relevant variables
  * Design a controlled experiment & show correlation
  * Demonstrate ability to predict new cases

![Confounding variables and example of baldness as predictor of covid risk](confoundingvariables.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Confounding Variables

* To identify spurious correlations between X and Y:
  * Identify potential confounding variables 
  * Control for those variables during measurement
	* Randomize, fix, or measure + account for during analysis
	* e.g., control for ''smoke'', check whether ''drink coffee" =>
      "pancreatic cancer"
* Other examples
  * Degree from top-ranked schools => higher salary
  * Age => credit card default rate
  * Exercise => skin cancer
