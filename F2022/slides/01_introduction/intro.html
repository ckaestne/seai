# Case Study: A Transcription Service Startup

## Transcription services

Take audio or video files and produce text.
- Used by academics to analyze interview text
- Podcast show notes
- Subtitles for videos

State of the art a few years ago: Manual transcription, often mechanical turk (1.5 $/min)

Recently: Many ML models for transcription (e.g., in Youtube, Alexa, Siri, Zoom)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The startup idea

PhD research on domain-specific speech recognition, that can detect technical jargon

DNN trained on public PBS interviews + transfer learning on smaller manually annotated domain-specific corpus

Research has shown amazing accuracy for talks in medicine, poverty and inequality research, and talks at Ruby programming conferences; published at top conferences

Idea: Let's commercialize the software and sell to academics and conference organizers
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Breakout: Likely challenges in building commercial product?

<div class="smallish">

As a group, think about challenges that the team will likely focus when turning their research into *a product*:
* One machine-learning challenge
* One engineering challenge in building the product
* One challenge from operating and updating the product
* One team or management challenge
* One business challenge
* One safety or ethics challenge

*Post answer to `#lecture` on Slack, include AndrewID of all group members*

## Software engineer

* Builds a product
* Concerned about cost, performance, stability, release time
* Identify quality through customer satisfaction
* Must scale solution, handle large amounts of data
* Detect and handle mistakes, preferably automatically
* Maintain, evolve, and extend the product over long periods

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## T-Shaped People

*Broad-range generalist + Deep expertise*

Example:
* Basic skills of software engineering, business, distributed computing, and communication
* Deep skills in deep neural networks (technique) and medical systems (domain)

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><div class="small">

## Examples for discussion

* What does correctness or accuracy really mean? What accuracy do customers care about?
* How can we see how well we are doing in practice? How much feedback are customers going to give us before they leave?
* Can we estimate how good our transcriptions are? How are we doing for different customers or different topics?
* How to present results to the customers (including confidence)?
* When customers complain about poor transcriptions, how to prioritize and what to do?
* 
* What are unacceptable mistakes and how can they be avoided? Is there a safety risk?
* Can we cope with an influx of customers?
* Will transcribing the same audio twice produce the same result? Does it matter? 
* How can we debug and fix problems? How quickly?

</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><div class="small">

## Examples for discussion 2

* With more customers, transcriptions are taking longer and longer -- what can we do?
* Transcriptions sometimes crash. What to do?
* How do we achieve high availability?
* How can we see that everything is going fine and page somebody if it is not?
* We improve our entity detection model but somehow system behavior degrades... Why?
* Tensorflow update; does our infrastructure still work?
* Once somewhat successful, how to handle large amounts of data per day?
* Buy more machines or move to the cloud?
*
* Models are continuously improved. When to deploy? Can we roll back?
* Can we offer live transcription as an app? As a web service?
* Can we get better the longer a person talks? Should we then go back and reanalyze the beginning? Will this benefit the next upload as well?

</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><div class="small">

## Examples for discussion 3

* How many domains can be supported? Do we have the server capacity?
* How specific should domains be? Medical vs "International Conference on Allergy & Immunology"?
* How to make it easy to support new domains?
* 
* Can we handle accents? 
* Better recognition of male than female speakers?
* 
* Can and should we learn from customer data? 
* How can we debug problems on audio files we are not allowed to see?
* Any chance we might private leak customer data? 
* Can competitors or bad actors attack our system?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Grading Philosophy

Specification grading, based in adult learning theory

Giving you choices in what to work on or how to prioritize your work

We are making every effort to be clear about expectations (specifications), will clarify if you have questions


Assignments broken down into expectations with point values, each graded **pass/fail**

Opportunities to resubmit work until last day of class

[[Example]](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/F2022/assignments/I1_mlproduct.md#grading)


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Token System for Flexibility

7 individual tokens per student:
- Submit individual assignment 1 day late for 1 token (after running out of tokens 15% penalty per late day)
- Redo individual assignment for 3 token
- Resubmit or submit reading quiz late for 1 token
- Remaining tokens count toward participation

7 team tokens per team:
- Submit milestone 1 day late for 1 token (no late submissions accepted when out of tokens)
- Redo milestone for 3 token 


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group project

Instructor-assigned teams

Teams stay together for project throughout semester, starting next week

Fill out Catme Team survey before Sep 6 11:59pm

Some advice in lectures; we'll help with debugging team issues

Peer grading on all milestones (based on citizenship on team)

Bonus points for social interaction in project teams

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Academic honesty

See web page

In a nutshell: do not copy from other students, do not lie, do not share or publicly release your solutions

In group work, be honest about contributions of team members, do not cover for others

If you feel overwhelmed or stressed, please come and talk to us (see syllabus for other support opportunities)
