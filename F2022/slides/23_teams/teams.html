* "Synchronize and stabilize"
* For each milestone
    * 6-10 weeks feature development and continuous testing

<div class="small">

> As the functional departments grew, staffing the heavily matrixed projects became more and more of a nightmare. To address this, the company reorganized itself into “Studios”, each with dedicated resources for each of the major functional areas reporting up to a Studio manager. Given direct responsibility for performance and compensation, Studio managers could allocate resources freely.

> The Studios were able to exert more direct control on the projects and team members, but not without a cost. The major problem that emerged from Brøderbund’s Studio reorganization was that members of the various functional disciplines began to lose touch with their functional counterparts. Experience wasn’t shared as easily. Over time, duplicate effort began to appear.

* People exerting less effort within a group
* Reasons
    * Diffusion of responsibility
    * Motivation
    * Dispensability of effort / missing recognition
    * Avoid pulling everybody / "sucker effect"
    * Submaximal goal setting
* “Evaluation potential, expectations of co-worker performance, task meaningfulness, and culture had especially strong influence”

* Involve all team members, colocation
* Assign specific tasks with individual responsibility
    * Increase identifiability
    * Team contracts, measurement
* Provide choices in selecting tasks
* Promote involvement, challenge developers
* Reviews and feedback
* Team cohesion, team forming exercises
* Small teams

* Involve team members in decision making
* Assign responsibilities (ideally goals not tasks)
* Record decisions and commitments; make record available

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## DevOps: A culture of collaboration

* Overcome historic role and goal conflicts between developers and operators
* Joint planning for operations, joint responsibilities for testing and deployment
*
* Joint goals, joint vocabulary
* Joint tools (e.g., Docker, versioning, A/B testing, monitoring)
* Mutual benefits (faster releases, more telemetry, improved reliability, fewer conflicts)
* T-shaped professionals
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Changing practices and culture is hard

* Ingrained "us vs them" and blame culture
* Inertia is hard to overcome (“this is how we always did things”)
* Learning cost for new concepts and tools
* Extra effort for new practices (e.g., testing)
* Overwhelmed with current tasks, no time to learn/change
* Poor adoption may cause more costs than benefits
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Working on Culture Change

* Bottom-up and top-down change possible
* Often introduced by individual advocates, convincing others
* Always requires supportive management
* Education helps generate buy-in
* Consultants can help with adoption and learning
* 
* Demonstrate benefits in one small project, promote from there
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Beyond DevOps

* Organizational culture and DevOps have been well studied
* Learn from joint goal setting, joint vocabulary, win-win-collaborations, joint tooling
*
* *What could this look like for other groups (MLOps, MLDev, SecDevOps, LawML, DataExp, SafeML, UIDev, ...)?*

* Know the signs, know the interventions
* Small teams, crossfunctional teams
	* Deliberately create teams, respect congruence, define interfaces
	* Hire T-Shared developers
* Create awareness and accountability
