## Data Provenance

<!-- colstart -->
* Track origin of all data
    - Collected where?
    - Modified by whom, when, why?
    - Extracted from what other data or model or algorithm?
* ML models often based on data drived from many sources through many steps, including other models

Whenever value is changed, record:
  - who changed it
  - time of change
  - history of previous values
  - possibly also justifcation of why

Embedded as feature in some databases or implemented in business logic

Possibly signing with cryptographic methods

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Tracking Data Lineage

Document all data sources

Identify all model dependencies and flows

Ideally model all data and processing code

Avoid "visibility debt"

(Advanced: Use infrastructure to automatically capture/infer dependencies and flows as in [Goods](http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45390.pdf))


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Feature Provenance

How are features extracted from raw data?
  - during training
  - during inference

Has feature extraction changed since the model was trained?

Recommendation: Modularize and version feature extraction code

**Example?**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Advanced Practice: Feature Store

Stores feature extraction code as functions, versioned

Catalog features to encourage reuse

Compute and cache features centrally

Use same feature used in training and inference code

Advanced: Immutable features -- never change existing features, just add new ones (e.g., creditscore, creditscore2, creditscore3)

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Model Provenance

How was the model trained?

What data? What library? What hyperparameter? What code?

Ensemble of multiple models?

* Append only databases
* Record edit events, never mutate data

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Versioning Strategies for Datasets

1. Store copies of entire datasets (like Git), identify by checksum
2. Store deltas between datasets (like Mercurial)
3. Offsets in append-only database (like Kafka), identify by offset
4. History of individual database records (e.g. S3 bucket versions)
    - some databases specifically track provenance (who has changed what entry when and how)
    - specialized data science tools eg [Hangar](https://github.com/tensorwerk/hangar-py) for tensor data
5. Version pipeline to recreate derived datasets ("views", different formats)
    - e.g. version data before or after cleaning?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Versioning Dependencies

Pipelines depend on many frameworks and libraries

Ensure reproducible builds
  - Declare versioned dependencies from stable repository (e.g. requirements.txt + pip)
  - Avoid floating versions
  - Optionally: commit all dependencies to repository ("vendoring")

Optionally: Version entire environment (e.g. Docker container)


Test build/pipeline on independent machine (container, CI server, ...)


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## ML Versioning Tools (MLOps)

Tracking data, pipeline, and model versions

Modeling pipelines: inputs and outputs and their versions
  - automatically tracks how data is used and transformed

Often tracking also metadata about versions
  - Accuracy
  - Training time
  - ...

**Replicability:** ability to reproduce results exactly
* Ensures everything is clear and documented
* All data, infrastructure shared; requires determinism

**Reproducibility:** the ability of an experiment to be repeated with minor differences, achieving a consistent expected result
* In science, reproducing important to gain confidence
* many different forms distinguished: conceptual, close, direct, exact, independent, literal, nonexperiemental, partial, retest, ...

2019 Study of 1.4M notebooks on GitHub:
- 21% had unexecuted cells
- 36% executed cells out of order
- 14% declare dependencies
- success rate for installing dependencies <40% (version issues, missing files)
- notebook execution failed with exception in >40% (often ImportError, NameError, FileNotFoundError)
- only 24% finished execution without problem, of those 75% produced different results

2020 Study of 936 executable notebooks:
- 40% produce different results due to nondeterminism (randomness without seed)
- 12% due to time and date
- 51% due to plots (different library version, API misuse)

Ability to generate the same research results or predictions 

Recreate model from data

Requires versioning of data and pipeline (incl. hyperparameters and dependencies)


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Nondeterminism

* Model inference almost always deterministic for a given model
* Many machine learning algorithms are nondeterministic
    - Nondeterminism in neural networks initialized from random initial weights
    - Nondeterminism from distributed computing, random forests
    - Determinism in linear regression and decision trees
* Many notebooks and pipelines contain nondeterminism
  - Depend on time or snapshot of online data (e.g., stream)
  - Initialize random seed
  - Different memory addresses for figures
* Different library versions installed on the machine

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Recommendations for Reproducibility

* Version pipeline and data (see above)
* Document each step   
    - document intention and assumptions of the process (not just results)
    - e.g., document why data is cleaned a certain way
    - e.g., document why certain parameters chosen
* Ensure determinism of pipeline steps (-> test)
* Modularize and test the pipeline
* Containerize infrastructure -- see MLOps
