</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Takeaway


* Software/ML models alone cannot fulfill system requirements
  * They are just one part of the system, and have limited control
    over the environment
* Environmental assumptions are just as critical in achieving requirements
  * If you ignore/misunderstand these, your system may fail or do poorly (no matter how good your model is)
  * Identify and document these assumptions as early as possible!
  * Some of the assumptions may be violated over time as the environment
  changes -- Monitor these assumptions and adjust your specification
        accordingly

For accessibility feature: What would you do?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Negotiating Requirements

Many requirements are conflicting/contradictory

Different stakeholders want different things, have different priorities, preferences, and concerns

Formal requirements and design methods such as [card sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_sorting), [affinity diagramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram), [importance-difficulty matrices](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2018/03/06/design-thinking-difficulty-importance-matrix/)

Generally: sort through requirements, identify alternatives and conflicts, resolve with priorities and decisions -> single option, compromise, or configuration


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Stakeholder Conflict Examples

*User wishes vs developer preferences:* free updates vs low complexity

*Customer wishes vs affected third parties:* privacy preferences vs disclosure

*Product owner priorities vs regulators:* maximizing revenue vs privacy protections

**Who makes the decisions?**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Requirements documentation


![paperwork](../_chapterimg/06_requirements.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Requirements documentation

Write down requirements 
* what the software *shall* do, what it *shall* not do, what qualities it *shall* have, 
* document decisions and rationale for conflict resolution

Requirements as input to design and quality assurance

Formal requirements documents often seen as bureaucratic, lightweight options in notes, wikis, issues common 

Systems with higher risk -> consider more formal documentation
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Requirements evaluation (validation!)

![Validation vs verification](validation.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain stretch" -->

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Requirements evaluation

Manual inspection (like code review)

Show requirements to stakeholders, ask for misunderstandings, gaps

Show prototype to stakeholders

Checklists to cover important qualities


Critically inspect assumptions for completeness and realism

Look for unrealistic ML-related assumptions (no false positives, unbiased representative data)

Requirements important in risky systems 

Requirements as basis of a contract (outsourcing, assigning blame)

Rarely ever fully completely upfront and stable, anticipate change
