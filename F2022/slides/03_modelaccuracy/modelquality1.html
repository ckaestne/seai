## Overfitting/Underfitting

<!-- colstart -->

<div class="small">

**Overfitting:** Model learned exactly for the input data, but does not generalize to unseen data (e.g., exact memorization)

**Underfitting:** Model makes very general observations but poorly fits to data (e.g., brightness in picture)

Typically adjust degrees of freedom during model learning to balance between overfitting and underfitting: can better learn the training data with more freedom (more complex models); but with too much freedom, will memorize details of the training data rather than generalizing

* Many split strategies, including

  * k-fold: $k$ equal-sized partitions, evaluate on each training on others
  * repeated random sub-sampling (Monte Carlo)

Use ML precisely because no specifications (too complex, rules unknown)
* No specification that could tell us for any input whether the output is correct
* Intuitions, ideas, goals, examples, "implicit specifications", but nothing we can write down as rules!
* *We are usually okay with some wrong predictions*

> All models are approximations. Assumptions, whether implied or clearly stated, are never exactly true. **All models are wrong, but some models are useful**. So the question you need to ask is not "Is the model true?" (it never is) but "Is the model good enough for this particular application?" -- George Box

"Newton's laws were verified by experiment and observation for over 200 years, and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life."

Do not generalize for very small scales, very high speeds, or in very strong gravitational fields. Do not explain semiconductor, GPS errors, superconductivity, ... Those require general relativity and quantum field theory.

Consequently, truth is a poor test for knowledge. The real test is utility. A theory that enables us to do new things constitutes knowledge. -- Yuval Harari in [Sapiens](https://bookshop.org/books/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind-9781467601573/9780062316110) about Francis Bacon's "*New Instrument*" from 1620




</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Find better models?

![Cancer prognosis with ML](cancerpred.png)

We are looking for models that better **fit** the problem

No specification of "correctness"

Some wrong predictions accepted, not too many though

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Typical accuracy evaluation

<div class="smallish">

Given example data, evaluate how well the model *fits* that data


```scala
def accuracy(model, xs, ys):
  count = length(xs)
  countCorrect = 0
  for i in 1..count:
    predicted = model(xs[i])
    if predicted == ys[i]:
      countCorrect += 1
  return countCorrect / count
```


Only sample inputs, like in software testing

Unlike traditional software *do not expect "correctness"*

## Inductive Reasoning

* Constructing axioms from observations
* Strong evidence suggests a rule
* From particular to the general
* *sciency reasoning, eg. finding laws of nature*
* 
* Most modern machine learning systems, statistical learning
<!-- col -->


## Deductive Reason.

* Combining logical statements following agreed upon rules to form new statements
* Proving theorems from axioms
* From general to the particular
* *mathy reasoning, eg. proof that π is irrational*
* 
* Formal methods, classic rule-based AI systems, expert systems

* A model is learned from given data in given procedure 
    - The learning process is typically not a correctness concern
    - The model itself is generated, typically no implementation issues
* Is the data representative? Sufficient? High quality?
* Does the model "learn" meaningful concepts?
*
* **Is the model useful for a problem?** Does it *fit*?
* Do model predictions *usually* fit the users' expectations?
* Is the model *consistent* with other requirements? (e.g., fairness, robustness)

* Also software engineers rarely assure "correctness"
* Testing finds bugs, does not assure their absence
* Formal verification possible, but expensive and rare
* Real challenges involve interactions with environment, which are hard to specify
*
* "Good enough" very common for software quality
* Evaluating "fit for intended purpose" instead of correctness too
