## Are Data Scientists Disappearing?

> However, AutoML does not spell the end of data scientists, as it doesn’t “AutoSelect” a business problem to solve, it doesn’t AutoSelect indicative data, it doesn’t AutoAlign stakeholders, it doesn’t provide AutoEthics in the face of potential bias, it doesn’t provide AutoIntegration with the rest of your product, and it doesn’t provide AutoMarketing after the fact. -- [Frederik Bussler](https://towardsdatascience.com/will-automl-be-the-end-of-data-scientists-9af3e63990e0)

![Tweet: "Virtually *everyone* is / will soon be building ML applications. Only few can afford dedicated software engineers to team up with, or SE education for themselves. It would be more inclusive to build SE into the ML processes more fundamentally, so that everyone could build better"](virtuallyeveryone.png)

*(better tools don't replace the knowledge to use them)*

## My View 

> This is an education problem, more than a research problem. 

> Interdisciplinary teams, mutual awareness and understanding

> Software engineers and data scientists will each play an essential role

----
## DevOps as a Role Model

Joint responsibilities, joint processes, joint tools, joint vocabulary

## Some things we tried

* Clear specifications for homework, pass/fail grading
* Open-ended reading quizzes
* Individual assignments and readings in pairs
* Team project mostly in second half of semester
* Guest lectures

----
## Feedback

* What was useful?
* What could be improved?
* Where did we overdo it with the homework?
